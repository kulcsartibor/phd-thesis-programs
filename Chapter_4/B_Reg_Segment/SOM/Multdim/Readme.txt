    SaGA  -  Spatial and Geometric Analysis Toolbox
    -----------------------------------------------

  SaGA is a collection of MATLAB programs dealing with
various aspects of geometric modeling and spatial data
interpolation and analysis.

  Its capabilities range from relatively simple yet
handy functions such a plotting circles, ellipsoids
or some fancy surfaces to very sophisticated 
computational procedures such as  multi-dimensional 
convex hull and Delaunay triangulation.

  Its core consists of functions dealing with irregular
two-, three- and multi-dimensional data sets.
In particular there are variety of programs for
interpolation and mapping from irregular points.
Most of them are intended for 2-dimensional data but
there are also procedures and templates for
multi-dimensional datasets.


  Its functionalities can be broadly divided into the
following categories:

  Planar geometry:
      points, lines, polygons - 
      area, centroid, intersections, point-in-polygon,
      boolean operations on pairs of polygons, etc.
  3-dimensional and spherical geometry:
      angles and distances on a sphere, 
      3-d motions and rotations.
  Multi-dimensional computational geometry:
      convex hull, n-dimensional Delaunay triangulation,
      volume, circumspheres,  boolean operations, etc.
  Interpolation, fitting, mapping:
      Triangulation, natural neighbour interpolation,
      options for extrapolation and blending with
      gradient information, objective mapping,
      kriging, minimum curvature,inverse distance, etc.
  Graphics:
      circles, ellipses, polygons, filled contour plots, 
      triangulated "patchwork" surfaces in 2- and 3-d,
      ellipsoids, tori, "tubes" and some other fancy
      surfaces.
