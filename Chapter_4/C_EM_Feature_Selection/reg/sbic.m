function SBIC = sbic(Residuals,n,k)

% Estimation of the Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criteria (SBIC)
%
% Information criteria provide a tradeoff between goodness-of-fit 
% (which lowers the sum of squared residuals) and the model's complexity, 
% which is measured by the number of parameters k+1.
% 
% Information criteria have to be minimized over choices of k+1.
%
% Since the penalty for additional regressors is larger in BIC, 
% this criterion tends to favor more parsimonious models than AIC.
